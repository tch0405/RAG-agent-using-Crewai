CrewAI is a Python framework to orchestrate multiple AI agents with roles and goals.
Agents can collaborate, retrieve knowledge, critique outputs, and form dynamic workflows.

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) combines a retriever + generator.
The retriever fetches documents from a vector store (like FAISS).
The generator (LLM) uses the retrieved context to answer the query accurately.

FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) is a fast vector database.
You create embeddings using models like all-MiniLM-L6-v2 and save them to FAISS.
Later, you retrieve top-K relevant chunks using cosine similarity.

RAG Evaluation: Use metrics like faithfulness, context precision, answer relevancy.
RAGAS is a tool to evaluate RAG pipelines with LLM-based scoring.
